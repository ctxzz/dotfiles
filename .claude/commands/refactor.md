# Code Refactoring: $ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Phase
1. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Identify code smells
   - Measure complexity metrics
   - Find duplication patterns
   - Assess maintainability

2. **Refactoring Strategy**
   - Extract reusable functions
   - Improve naming conventions
   - Simplify complex logic
   - Enhance type safety

## Implementation Phase
1. **Preserve Functionality**
   - Maintain existing behavior
   - Keep test coverage intact
   - Ensure backward compatibility

2. **Improve Structure**
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Cleaner abstractions
   - Improved readability

## Common Refactoring Patterns
- Extract Method/Function: Break down large functions
- Extract Variable: Make complex expressions readable
- Replace Magic Numbers: Use named constants
- Consolidate Conditional: Simplify complex conditions
- Remove Dead Code: Eliminate unused code

## Validation
- Run existing test suite
- Verify performance impact
- Check for breaking changes
