## Cognitive Biases to Watch

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking info that confirms beliefs
   - Mitigation: Actively look for contradicting evidence

2. **Anchoring**: Relying too heavily on first piece of info
   - Mitigation: Consider multiple perspectives

3. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Continuing because of past investment
   - Mitigation: Evaluate based on future value only

4. **Status Quo Bias**: Preferring things stay the same
   - Mitigation: Explicitly evaluate "do nothing" cost

5. **Availability Bias**: Overweighting recent/memorable info
   - Mitigation: Look at data and statistics

6. **Groupthink**: Going with consensus without critical thinking
   - Mitigation: Encourage dissenting opinions

## Guidelines

- **Be objective**: Use data, not just gut feeling
- **Consider long-term**: Short-term gains vs long-term costs
- **Test assumptions**: What if key assumptions are wrong?
- **Get input**: Consult relevant stakeholders
- **Document**: Record decision and rationale
- **Set review points**: When will we check if this was right?
- **Accept uncertainty**: Some decisions require judgment
- **Avoid paralysis**: Better a good decision now than perfect decision never
- **Learn from results**: Review outcomes to improve future decisions

## Decision Confidence

### High Confidence
- Clear criteria
- Objective data available
- Reversible if wrong
- Consensus among experts

### Medium Confidence
- Some ambiguity
- Mixed data
- Moderate stakes
- Differing opinions

### Low Confidence
- High uncertainty
- Limited data
- Irreversible
- Novel situation

→ Adjust depth of analysis to confidence level

## When NOT to Decide

- Insufficient information (can easily get more)
- Too emotional (wait for calm)
- Under pressure (artificial deadline)
- Missing key stakeholders (need their input)
- Better to experiment first (can test small scale)

Sometimes the best decision is to defer the decision.
